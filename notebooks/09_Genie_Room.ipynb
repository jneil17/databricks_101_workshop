    "## 💡 Best Practices for Genie Rooms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question Formulation 📝\n",
    "- ✅ **Be specific** about what you want to know\n",
    "- ✅ **Use natural language** (don't try to think like SQL)\n",
    "- ✅ **Ask follow-up questions** to dive deeper\n",
    "- ✅ **Specify time periods** or filters when relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Better Results 🎯\n",
    "```\n",
    "Instead of: \"Show data\"\n",
    "Try: \"Show me the top 10 drivers by wins in the last 20 years\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of: \"Compare drivers\"\n",
    "Try: \"Compare Hamilton and Verstappen's win percentages and podium rates\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of: \"F1 trends\"\n",
    "Try: \"How has the average age of F1 winners changed since 2000?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterative Exploration 🔄\n",
    "1. **Start broad:** \"Show me top F1 drivers\"\n",
    "2. **Get specific:** \"What about their performance in different decades?\"\n",
    "3. **Add context:** \"How does this compare to drivers from their home countries?\"\n",
    "4. **Find insights:** \"Which of these trends is most surprising?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sharing Results 📤\n",
