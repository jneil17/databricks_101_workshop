## 🏎️ F1 Q&A Bot Example

Let's design an intelligent F1 chatbot using your workshop data!

**[Screenshot: AI Agent interface showing F1 chatbot conversation with driver statistics queries]**
*📁 Image location: `images/06_f1_chatbot_demo.png`*
*Screenshot guidance: Show the Agent Playground with a conversation about F1 drivers, including questions like "Who has the most wins?" and the bot's responses with data*

### 🎯 F1 Bot Capabilities:

```
🏁 "Who is the most successful F1 driver of all time?"
Bot: "Based on our F1 database, Lewis Hamilton leads with 103 career wins 
     and 198 podium finishes across 310 races..."

🏎️ "Show me drivers from Britain with more than 20 wins"
Bot: "Here are British drivers with 20+ wins:
     • Lewis Hamilton: 103 wins
     • Nigel Mansell: 31 wins
     • Jackie Stewart: 27 wins..."

📊 "What's the trend in F1 safety over the decades?"
Bot: "F1 safety has dramatically improved. In the 1960s-70s, we saw frequent 
     DNFs due to mechanical failures. Modern F1 (2000+) shows much higher 
     completion rates and safety innovations..."

• Team performance and constructor championships
• F1 regulations, eras, and technical evolution

Always provide specific data points and statistics when available. 
If you're unsure about something, clearly state your uncertainty.
Keep responses conversational but informative.
```

### Step 4: Test in Playground 🎮

```
User: "Show me British drivers with the most podiums"
SQL Agent: 
SELECT full_name, nationality, podiums 
FROM main.default.gold_driver_standings 
WHERE nationality = 'British' 
ORDER BY podiums DESC 
LIMIT 10
```
