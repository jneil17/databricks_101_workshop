## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **"Cannot create Volume" Error**
```
Problem: Volume creation fails in notebook 00_Setup
Solution: Ensure you're using main.default catalog (trial default)
Verify: Check catalog permissions in left sidebar → Catalog
```

```
Problem: COPY INTO Failed" Error
Solution: Check internet connection and retry notebook 00_Setup
Alternative: Download CSVs manually to Volume via UI
```

#### **"Serverless Compute Unavailable"**
```
Problem: Serverless option not showing in compute selection
Solution: 1. Refresh browser page
          2. Try creating new notebook
          3. Contact support if trial limitation
```

#### **"Table Not Found" in Later Notebooks**
```
Problem: Silver/Gold tables missing in notebooks 03-11
Solution: Complete notebook 00_Setup fully first (downloads all data)
Alternative: Check notebook 03 creates all tables from downloaded data
Verify: Check Data Explorer → main → default for 8 tables
```

#### **Screenshot Placeholders Not Rendering**
```
Problem: Markdown files show raw text instead of placeholder
Solution: View in Databricks workspace (not GitHub preview)
Note: Screenshots will be added to images/ folder
```
